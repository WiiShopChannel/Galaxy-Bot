# Galaxy's Bot


Howdy! I'm Galaxy, a ROBLOX scripter and Lua extraordinaire. Here's a quick tutorial on how to get this bot running.



First, head over to https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/ and click **New Application**.

Second, give it a *hot and spicy* name and click **Create**

Third, give your bot some customization. It's gotta be hip and cool for your discord buddies :sunglasses:

After your bot is to your liking, navigate over to **Settings** and click **Bot**, then click **Add Bot**. Remember, this action is **irreversible**.

Once you get your bot setup, navigate over to where your bot's **token** is. Click copy to copy it to your clipboard.

After you have your token copied, open up your bot and edit **bot.lua**. I suggest using something like **VS Code**, **Notepad++**, or **Atom**.

Scroll all the way down on **bot.lua** and on the last line you should see an area to put your token.

Simply put your token in and save the file.

Now you're ready to start your bot! Go back to your bot folder and hit **start.bat**.
